## About

I started programming in university with mostly Python and Java. As much as I enjoyed the theoretical background of Computer Science such as recursion and data structures, I struggled finding joy in creating products that people could use.
Fast forward into my last year of university, I took a web development course that exposed me to fullstack development. I started understanding the bigger picture of the WHYs and HOWs instead of just the WHATs.
I took upon a testing role at RBC after graduation and within a couple of months, I craved for something more creative and challenging. It's been officially 8 months where I have started developing applications mainly in JavaScript and Python (including bootcamp and self teaching).
I'm hoping to make an impact in a company that I truly enjoy working for - and to ultimately grow and build with for the long term!
